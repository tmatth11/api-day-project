# Pokemon Card Generator

![Cover Image](images/cover-image.png)

This is a simple web application that generates a Pokemon card based on user input. It fetches the relevant data from the PokeAPI and displays it in a Pokemon card. The card can be downloaded as an image, but it is not entirely perfect.
